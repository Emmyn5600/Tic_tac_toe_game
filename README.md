## Game Instructions

* How do we play Tic Tac Toe?

- Players take turns playing
- 1st turn — Player 1
- Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
- 2nd turn — Player 2
- Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can’t touch the square that Player 1’s token already fills
- 3rd turn- Player 1 …. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there’s a tie game
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
- There’s a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X’s and O’s but no winning combinations can be found

* A winning combination should look like
